Hello weary net-traveller. Take a seat and enjoy the configuration files.

You will have to change some of the options, as they hold personal information.

such as my gnus.el config has my name and email (as well as my configuration for my mail server with Google Apps)

I hope you can find some utility with them.

Take care net-traveller,
Athetius.
